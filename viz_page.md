### [Species Zoomable Treemap](https://apps-fall.ischool.berkeley.edu/~arshiasharma/w209/final/species/)
 
This visualization presents a unique application of a D3 zoomable treemap, specifically designed to explore the intricate taxonomy of species inhabiting National Parks. By innovating on the standard treemap model, I've integrated enhanced navigation features and a sophisticated color scheme, significantly improving data interaction and visual clarity. This project not only demonstrates a creative use of technology in biological data representation but also reflects my fascination in advancing data visualization techniques for complex hierarchical structures.

### [Vizualizing National Park Species Endangerment ](https://apps-fall.ischool.berkeley.edu/~arshiasharma/w209/final/species_explorer/)
 
This visualization uniquely navigates from a broad overview of biodiversity across national parks to detailed, species-level granularity, offering a comprehensive yet focused exploration of ecological data. Through interactive elements like dropdown menus and dynamic charts, it allows users to seamlessly filter extensive datasets, providing insights into specific species and conservation statuses.

### [Los Angeles Crime Data 2020-2023 Choropleth](https://apps-fall.ischool.berkeley.edu/~arshiasharma/w209/final/species_explorer/)
 
In my recent data visualization project, I delved into the nuanced relationship between crime rates and population densities, employing advanced normalization techniques to avoid oversimplified generalizations. Utilizing Python's Pandas and Plotly libraries, I created interactive choropleth maps that accurately represent crime data across various ZIP codes. This work highlights my commitment to ethical data analysis and my skill in transforming complex datasets into insightful, visual narratives.
