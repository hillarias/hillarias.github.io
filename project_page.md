### [Citibike Station Analysis](/pdf/citibike_presentation.pdf)
 
In this project, we analyzed ten years of CitiBike customer data, mapping journey start and end points to produce a neighborhood-based choropleth. This visual representation of user patterns informed our recommendations for new station placements.

### [Optimized Pairing Analysis: Enhancing E-Commerce Strategies with Graph-Based Data Science](/pdf/northwinds.pdf)
 
This project involved analyzing the Northwind database to identify products often purchased together, using graph-based Bayesian analysis and community detection algorithms such as Louvain Modularity. The insights were applied to enhance both online product recommendations and warehouse storage layouts.

### [Precision Confluency Analysis in Live/Dead Stain Assays](/pdf/northwinds.pdf)
 
This application employs dual-channel live/dead staining to enhance microcarrier segmentation through the exploitation of autofluorescence properties. It adeptly performs binary inversion and subtraction on the segmented images to remove non-adherent floaters. The core functionality lies in its sophisticated algorithm, which calculates confluency by quantifying the ratio of the microcarriers' area to the live signal's area, thereby offering a precise and reliable metric for cell culture analysis in biotechnological research.
